Is "good" good enough? Not always. If a thing is worth doing, it's worth doing well, right now! In everything I do, I strive for excellence. This is why I joined [Zuhlke](https://www.zuehlke.com/en).

I am a technology advocate, proficient in software architecture, and web and mobile application development, covering wide-ranging knowledge domains including FinTech, AI, Telecom, and social media. I have 20 years of experience delivering projects at different complexity scales and am most enthusiastic about building ideas from the grounds-up into full-scale value-generating operations. As a champion of cloud infrastructures and DevOps, I am recognised and certified as a Professional Cloud Architect by Google, a Certified Developer by AWS, and a Certified Azure Administrator by Microsoft.
